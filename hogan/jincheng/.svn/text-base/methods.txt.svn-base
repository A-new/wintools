Detection Methodology
-----------------------
ProcL uses many different approaches at 2 different level (ring-3 & ring-0) in the operating system
1. User-mode approaches:
    	- ToolHelpAPI
    	- EnumProcess API
    	- Performance data helper
    	- ZwQuerySystemInformation - Class "SystemProcessesAndThreadsInformation"
    	- Open handle scanning
    	- Process Bruteforcing
    	- Scanning handles open in another process
2. Kernel-mode approaches:
    	- EPROCESS structure scanning
    	- PspCidTable scanning
    	- HandleTableList scanning
    	- Scheduler threads list scanning
    	- SwapContext hooking
What ProcL is NOT?
---------------------
1. May not work on Windows Vista (not tested)
2. ProcL can not detect hidden - modules, threads, drivers, files, folders, and registry keys
3. ProcL does not restore any hooks
4. ProcL is not going to keep you Rootkit free!
Future work
------------
1. Vista support
2. Process killing
3. XML output
